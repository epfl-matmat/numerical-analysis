# Introduction
## Opening remarks

[Slides of the presentation on Moodle](https://teaching.matmat.org/): These summarise the following paragraphs and the content of the course in a short presentation.

In modern practice **every scientist employs computers**. Some use them to symbolically derive equations for complex theories, others perform simulations, yet others analyse and visualise experimental results. In all these cases we encounter **mathematical problems**, which we need to **solve using numerical techniques**.
The point of this lecture is to learn how to **formalise such numerical procedures** mathematically,
**implement them** using the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/)
and **analyse using pen and paper** why some methods work better,
some worse and some not at all.

You might think learning about this is a bit of an overkill and probably not very useful for your future studies. But let us look at a few examples, which give an overview what we will study in more depth throughout the course.

## How this course works

Context of the course:

- In this lecture we focus very much on **teaching you the high-level ideas** of key numerical algorithms. We keep proofs to a minimal level, where they are easy or help understanding, but **not all technicalities can be avoided**.
- The **role of this lecture** in the study curriculum is to **provide a broad overview of many numerical techniques**, which you will need in future classes. Unfortunately in this lecture **we have little time to go into more interesting applications**. While we do employ examples to motivate our mathematical study, these examples therefore can appear constructed or only loosely connected to the rest of your studies.

How to get the most out of this course:

- **All content** of the lecture is in the **online lecture notes**.
  Note that these are a **living document**.
  Expect them to improve over the semester based on errors we find or based on questions that come up during the lecture.
- The **additional PDF documents** are provided as references. Their content is similar and they can serve you as additional learning resources.
- The **blackboard derivations** is only **meant to slow me down**
  and give you the chance to follow the more technical parts of the derivations
  and ask questions about them.
  In principle **everything I say is also written down in the lecture notes**.
  It is up to you whether you **just want to listen**,
  you **want to copy all discussion** on the blackboard or you simply
  **print or otherwise annotate the PDFs** we provide online.
- The **expectation is *not* that you leave the lecture understanding everything** that is said, much rather that you will understand it after you go through the lecture notes once again for yourself.
- With that said **it can be helpful to read through the lecture notes** for the next session **before going to the session** itself.
- In the lecture **I often pause and ask for questions**. This is your chance to slow me down in case you are lost: **any question is appreciated**.

## Taking derivatives

Before we dive into the main content of the course, the remainder of this chapter provides some examples for numerical problems and their challenges when solving them numerically. These examples serve to pose motivating questions, which we seek to answer throughout the course.

We first consider the problem of **taking derivatives**.
Derivatives characterise the change of a quantity of interest.
E.g. the acceleration as a derivative of the velocity indeed characterises
how the velocity changes over time.

More broadly any experiment in physics or engineering operates by imposing a change to a material or chemical system (e.g. changing temperature, pressure, stress etc.) and observing how it reacts.

As a result **derivatives are therefore at the heart of physics and engineering**
and appear everywhere in these subjects.
But computing derivatives by hand is not always easy. To see this consider the **innocent-looking velocity function**.

Clearly between $0$ and $1$ the function changes quite rapidly. To investigate the **acceleration** there **we take the derivative**.

This can be done by hand, but instead we will employ a Julia package (namely [`Symbolics`](https://symbolics.juliasymbolics.org/)) to take the derivative for us. The result is:

Clearly far from a handy expression and not the kind of derivative one wants to compute by hand. 

So let us **compute this derivative numerically** instead.
An idea to do so goes back to the definition of the derivative $v'(t)$ as the limit $h\to 0$ of the slope of secants over an intervall $[t, t+h]$, i.e.
```math
v'(t) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{v(t+h) - v(t)}{h}.
```
A natural idea is to not fully take the limit, i.e. to take a small $h > 0$
and approximate
```math
\tag{1}
v'(t) ≈ \frac{v(t+h) - v(t)}{h}.
```
The expectation is that as we take smaller and **smaller values for $h$**,
this **converges to the exact derivatives**.

So let's try this at the point `t0 = ` $t0 for various values for `h`

Moreover numerical approximations of derivatives are key ingredients when solving **differential equations**. For example, suppose we know that the voltage of an electrical system changes in time according to the derivative
```math
\frac{d u(t)}{d t} = \sin\left[(u+t)^2\right]
```
and we know that at time $t=0$ the voltage is $u(0) = -1$.
Our goal is to know the behaviour of $u(t)$ for *all future values* of $t$.

As we will discuss towards the end of this course (in [Initial value problems](https://teaching.matmat.org/numerical-analysis/12_Initial_value_problems.html)),
approximating the derivative $\frac{d u(t)}{d t}$ by a formula like (1) will lead to a family of numerical schemes, which achieves exactly that.

## Representing numbers on a computer

Let us try to shed some light why results in the previous example on numerically computing derivatives get worse and worse as we take smaller stepsizes $h$. For this purpose let us reconsider the expression for approximating the derivative $v'(t)$, which we obtained in (1), namely
```math
v'(t) ≈ \frac{v(t+h) - v(t)}{h}.

### Structure of floating-point numbers

As we found out above in practice the **set of floating-point numbers** is much smaller than the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ and **not all numbers can be represented as a floating-point numbers**.
This leads to the natural question: **which numbers can be represented** on a computer. 

Answering this in all details is beyond the scope of this course (see for example <https://teaching.matmat.org/error-control/05_Floating_point_arithmetic.html> for more information). However, getting some intuition is helpful to obtain a feeling how large floating-point errors can be. 
"""

# ╔═╡ 1b1e6f9b-a6db-4dd4-bcbf-f7a0cb24cca2
md"""
The **set of floating-point numbers** has elements of the form
```math
y = \pm m \, \beta^{e-t}.
```
It is thus characterised by four integer parameters:
- the **base** (or radix) $\beta$. Almost always binary, i.e. $β = 2$,
- the **number of significand digits** $t$ and
- the **exponent range** $e_\text{min} \leq e \leq e_\text{max}$.

In the definition of $y$ the integer $m$ is the **significand** (or mantissa),
which has $t$ number of digits, i.e. $m = (a_1 a_2 \cdots a_t)$,
which satisfy $0 < a_1 \leq β-1$ and $0 ≤ a_i ≤ β-1$ for $i=2,\ldots,t$.

The most common case are **double-precision floating-point numbers**
with $β=2$, $t = 24$, $e_\text{min} = -1023$ and $e_\text{max} = +1022$.

This is unfortunately too many numbers to illustrate easily. To still get a visual representation of the "denseness" of floating-point numbers,
we therefore consider a toy case with $\beta = 2$, $t = 3$, $e_\text{min} = -1$ and $e_\text{max} = 3$. Considering only the positive numbers, the following numbers can be represented:

We notice that the **representable numbers** get **less and less dense** as we move to to larger values --- a conclusion which remains true for double-precision floating-point numbers. 

This construction has one key advantage, namely that the **relative error due to rounding** remains finite. Or in other words if $fl(x)$ denotes the result of rounding the real number $x$ into the set of representable floating-point numbers, then

!!! info "Definition: Machine epsilon"
	The **machine epsilon** $ε_M = β^{1-t}$ is the smallest real number greater
	than zero, such that $fl(1+ε_M) > 1$. The **roundoff error** $\frac{ε_M}{2}$
	is an upper bound to the relative error in representing a real number
	$x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$, i.e.
	```math
	\frac{|x - fl(x)|}{|x|} ≤ \frac{ε_M}{2} 
	```

	Standard elementary floating-point operations (e.g. addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) have similarly at most a relative error of $\frac{ε_M}{2}$. E.g. for the case of adding two floating-point numbers
	$x$ and $y$ we have
	```math
	\frac{|(x+y) - fl(x + y)|}{|x + y|} ≤ \frac{ε_M}{2}.

Now the arguments to introduce Method 1 were in fact a little convoluted. Let's try to directly balance the voltage across the circuit, i.e. directly employ $V = v_R + v_D$. Then using equations (2a) to (2c) this leads to:
```math
\tag{5}
V = v_R + v_D = R\, i + v_D = R \, i_0 \left( e^{v_D/v_0} - 1 \right) + v_D
```
or
```math
V - R \, i_0 \left( e^{v_D/v_0} - 1 \right) = v_D
```
Introducing a function
```math
\tag{6}
g_\text{exp}(x) = V - R \, i_0 \left( e^{x/v_0} - 1 \right).
```
we again observe a fixed-point problem $g_\text{exp}(v_D) = v_D$.
We again iterate as before:

As we will see in the next lectures there are a number of numerical techniques to solve such nonlinear fixed-point problems $g(x) = x$. Each of these have their advantages and disadvantages and hardly any of them just work.

Let us also note already here that **fixed-point problems are closely related to root-finding problems** (*frz. trouver des zéros*). Namely if $x$ is a fixed-point of $g$ than it is a root of $f(x) = g(x) - x$.

Often for a scientific problem there are **many choices how to formulate it as a fixed-point or root-finding problem**. Therefore there are usually **many choices how to solve the same problem on a computer**. As we saw above not all of these options work equally well.

This immediately raises some questions:

```math
\tag{4}
k(T) = A \exp\left( - \frac{E_A}{k_B T} \right)

establishes such a relationship, where $A$, $E_A$ and $k_B$ are some constants.

Still, it seems reasonable that 
we should be able to **determine some continuous function**
$f$ **from the observed data**,
which **establishes a good model** for the relationship $k = f(T)$.
Albeit $255 K$ has not been measured, we can thus evaluate $f(255 K)$
and get an estimate for the rate at this temperature.
Since the new temperature $255 K$ islocated *within* the observed data range (i.e. here $250K$ to $350K$) we call this procedure **interpolation**.

In this lecture we will discuss some common interpolation techniques. In particular we will develop the **mathematical formalism** for these techniques and --- most importantly --- we will use this formalism to understand conditions when these methods work and **when these methods fail**.

In fact our example here is already a little tricky. 
Let us illustrate this point for **polynomial interpolation**, one particularly frequent technique. Without going into details for now, one basic idea is to fit a polynomial of degree $N$
```math
k(T) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} α_n T^n
```
to the data. By some procedure discussed later we thus determine
the unknown polynomial coefficients $α_n$,
such that the polynomial best matches our observations
and use that to determine $f(255 K)$.

Let's see the result of such a fit.
The slider let's you play with the polynomial order:
